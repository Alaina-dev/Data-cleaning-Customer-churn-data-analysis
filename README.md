# Data-cleaning-Customer-churn-data-analysis
*This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a customer churn dataset using Python and the pandas library in Google Colab. The aim is to convert raw, unstructured data into a clean, reliable dataset ready for analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.
The project reflects a real-world data cleaning workflow commonly used by data analysts before performing churn analysis and dashboard* reporting.
# Tools and Technologies Used
This project was completed entirely in Google Colab using Python and the pandas library. The openpyxl engine was used for handling Excel files. Google Drive was used for file storage and exporting cleaned datasets.
# Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of multiple Excel worksheets representing different aspects of customer behavior, including customer demographics, service usage, transaction history, online activity, and churn status. Each worksheet was cleaned separately to ensure accuracy, consistency, and data integrity before further analysis.
# Data Cleaning Process
To run this project, you need both the raw dataset and the pandas cleaning notebook.
First, download or clone this repository from GitHub. The repository contains the pandas cleaning notebook used in this project.[Customer_churn_data.ipynb](Customer_churn_data.ipynb) and the raw dataset (Customer_Churn_Data_Large-2.xlsx)
# Output Files
The final output of this project is a cleaned Excel dataset stored in Google Drive. This dataset is ready for use in exploratory data analysis, customer behavior analysis, churn prediction modeling, and business intelligence dashboards.
